Visualization is an efficient way of learning any concept faster than conventional methods. Modern technology allows creating e-Learning tools that also helps in improving computer science education very much. Algorithm Visualizations contribute to improving computer science education. The method of teaching and learning algorithms is commonly complex to understand the problem.
The goal of this project is to create a web based ‘PathFinding Visualizer’, which can be used to visualize shortest path algorithms. The conceptual application of the project is illustrated by implementation of algorithms like BFS (Breadth First Search) ,Bidirectional Breadth First and A*. Path Finding algorithms are build on top of Graph search algorithms and explore routes between nodes, starting at one node and traversing through relationships until the destination has been reached
